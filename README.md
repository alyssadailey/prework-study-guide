# <Prework-Study-Guide Webpage>

## Description

The main objective of creating this page, was to create an organized, and user friendly interface to help coding bootcamp students navigate studying the four main elements that go into creating your own webpage. I felt a great motivation to create this webpage, as a bootcamp student myself.  I knew that this page would be a crucial tool for me to look back on, and use during my next steps as a bootcamp student. This knowledge pushed me to create the best possible webpage, with only the most important, and crucial information on my page, as to not overwhelm myself, or any other bootcamp students who are new to navigating the coding world while still hilighting the main objectives that I learned. This project not only guides students on how to create a web page of their own, it also gives students a referenece page to showcase all of the information that was learned while completing the prework, in a very structured and organized way. I was able to learn about the crucial elements of Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As well as how to piece these four elements together to create a working webpage.

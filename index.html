      <h2>HTML</h2>
          <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visable content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Elements included within the head element are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>Elements included within the body element are visible to users.</li>
          <li>The declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened. This particular declaration is expecting an HTML on the page.</li>
          <li>!DOCTYPE is not case-sensitive because it's a dec. Decs are not case sensitive; HTML elements ARE case sensitive.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for SEO (search engine optimization).</li>
          <li>SEO is the process of improving the ranking of a website in search engines such as google or bing. Better SEO results in your website means more frequently showing up in searches.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author and viewport.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.</li>
          <li>The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element.</li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements the name of the element describes it's content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
          <li>It's important to use Semantic HTML elements because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser. They also play an important role in making sure your webpage is accessible to all, including those using assistive tech.</li>
          <li>Not all elements are semantic. It's common to see non-semantic elements such as div to create a division in the page or spam to create an inline division.</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag. A tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6- these are levels of heading- always need to be in cronological order- h1 sould only be used one time per page.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text. You will use this extensively to wrap most text on your webpages.</li>
          <li>ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li>img element contains info about images that are displayed on the webpage. The src attribute is the most important attribute listed cause it defines the location or source of the image.</li>
          <li>br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break.</li>
          <li>a element stands for anchor. It creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
          <li>The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
          <li>The alt attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
          <li>The alt text is important for screen readers and other assistives techs. Alt text can also improve search engine ranks for your website.</li>
          <li>The footer element appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, site map, and navigation.</li>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a programming language to define how webpage content is presented to the user.</li>
        <li>A margin indecates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin property acts much lie a margin in a word processing doc.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger. That is because the padding while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside element.</li>
        <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
        <li>When you want to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS.</li>
        <li>Ex. of inline CSS is using the style attribute to change the color of a single h1 heading.</li>
        <li>A single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
        <li>The internal style sheet contains CSS rules for a webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
        <li>Although inline CSS and internal style sheets are acceptable, the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet, which allows developers to keep all of their CSS rules in a seperate file.</li>
        <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file with changes using a link element placed in the HTML head. In this ex we put it after the meta and before the title.</li>
        <li>Seperation of concerns- widely used term that refers to seperating code into different files based on use.</li>
        <li>To create a new feature branch use following git commands: git status, git checkout main, git checkout -b feature/add-css.</li>
        <li> When breaking down a CSS rule, there is first a selector that defines the element or attribute to which the tules or declarations will apply.</li>
        <li>Declarations contain 2 important components: the CSS property we want to apply, and the value of said property.</li>
        <li>The CSS Box model teaches about content box, padding, border, and margin and how they interact with one another.</li>
        <li>Content box: the area where your content is displayed; size it using properties like inline-size and block-size or width and height.</li>
        <li>Padding box: the padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties.</li>
        <li>Border box: the border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using border and related properties.</li>
        <li>Margin box: the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using margin and related properties.</li>
        <li>In order to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page use "*".</li>
        <li>You can combine 2 selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declaration to affect both selectors.</li>
        <li>DRY- Don't Repeat Yourself- coding principle that encourages develpers to combine steps in order to reduce the number of lines used in code.</li>
        <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup.</li>
        <li>The display property is assigned with the block value which assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
        <li>Must format lists and p text in order to center all text and size the font.</li>
        <li>In order to link new changes, go back to main file, and add link to head.</li>
        <li>Used link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css" to add our changes.</li>
        <li>Link- a link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
        <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current doc and the linked doc resource.</li>
        <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. The href attribute is using a relative path. This means the location is derived from the current location (in this case index.html). To locate the style sheet from the current location we must look in the assets, hence the assets/style.css.</li>
        <li>Class attributes will allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
        <li>To differenciate topics, we added box-shadows around each note topics, to keep it visually appealing as well as organized.</li>
        <li>To add shadow boxes we used ".card" to apply the box to all topics.</li>
        <li>When selecting colors for elements of your webpage, we use an HTML hexadecimal code to define each color. This just means that there is a corosponding color for each and every specific shade.</li>

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
        <li>Each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon to avoid errors</li>
        <li>In a variable there is always a declaration, and an initializer.</li>
        <li>The declaration allows the variable to be accessed later in the code.</li>
        <li>The initializer assigns a value to the variable.</li>
        <li>JavaScript has 3 kinds of variable declarations.</li>
        <li>"const” declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant. It allows us to create variables that can't be reassigned a value. It essentially “locks down” what that variable will be.</li>
        <li>"let" declares a block-coped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</li>
        <li>"var" declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</li>
        <li>By creating a string of all of the topics we were studying, we can refer to the variable's.</li>
        <li>We can use the console.log method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument.</li>
        <li>When you are ready to link your JavaScript changes, you will use the console log method bellow the footer and above the closing element for the body.</li>
        <li>To open Chrome DevTools use Control+Shift+I or right click and hit "inspect".</li>
        <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executer, or if it's executer at all.</li>
        <li>When a computer encounters an if statement in a JavaScript file it will check to see if the condition that we provide is truthy. If it is, it will do the action we ask it to do in between the curly brackets.</li>
        <li>If the condition isn't true, or has a value that isn't truthy or falsy, then the computer will ignore what's in the curly brackets and move on.</li>
        <li>A value is falsy if it is one of the following values: 0,-0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type wuth the value of false.</li>
        <li>All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are truthy.</li>
        <li>When we want to provide more conditions than just one, you can use "else if".</li>
        <li>We use "===" in each of our conditions. The strict equality operator "===" checks to see if two valuse are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
        <li>To evaluate dozens or hundreds of values at the same time, we use an array.</li>
        <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays typically are used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
        <li>Arrays are not limited to contain only a single type of data. A single array can store strings, numbers, and so on.</li>
        <li>An example of an array that holds multiple types of data is the example about "Lu". The array held his name, age, and whether it was true or false if he was currently enrolled.</li>
        <li>Strings must be in quatation marks, like "Lu". Since 54 is a number and true is a Boolean value, no quotes are needed.</li>
        <li>When trying to work with a single data item in an array, we simply used the variable name to access the stored data, and the location of the data item in the array.</li>
        <li>The location is identified with a unique number called an index. Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential, which means that the first item will always have an index of 0. Each one to follow will go up in increments of 1.</li>
        <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
        <li>Developers must use another statement such as the conditional if statement to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
        <li>A for loop begins with "for".</li>
        <li>Next we used "let x = 0;" to announce to start at the first variable in the array.</li>
        <li>Then, we use x<shapes.length; x++ to repeat the action for all other variables in the array until there are no more variables left.</li>
        <li>Finally, we put the code that we want executed for each loop in the curly brackets. We used "console.log(shapes[x]);".</li>
        <li>We can comment out code. This makes it inactive without deleting it. You can do this by using "*/".</li>
        <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
        <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file (in our case, script.js) is run.</li>
        <li>Instead you must call a function by name in order to execute it.</li>
        <li>Being able to call a function to execute it also means you can control where in the control flow a task is executed, or if it is executed at all.</li>
        <li>To create a function we use the function keyword, similar to how we used the const or let keyword to declare a variable.</li>
        <li>Then we give our function a unique name. We use this unique name to whenever we call the function.</li>
        <li>A function's name is followed by parantheses. This is a very important step to remember when writing a function.</li>
        <li>In order for the code inside a function to run, we must call the function. To do so, type the name of the function in the console with parantheses and a semicolon.</li>
